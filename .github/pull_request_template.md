## Reminders:

- [ ] Did you up the mix.exs version?
- If adding a new smart city data module:
  - [ ] does it have a relevant test
  - [ ] If a struct was added to an existing struct, was the parent `.new` method updated to convert keys to atoms
- If updating an existing module's type:
  - [ ] was it's @moduledoc updated as well
